# 🎓 Linear Regression – Predict Marks Based on Study Hours

This project uses **Linear Regression** to predict how many marks a student will get based on the number of hours they studied.

## 📊 Dataset
A manually created dataset with:
- `X` = Hours studied
- `y` = Marks obtained

| Hours | Marks |
|-------|-------|
| 2     | 40    |
| 4     | 50    |
| 6     | 60    |
| 8     | 80    |
| 10    | 95    |

## 📌 Goal
To understand how Linear Regression works in a basic ML model using:
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`

## 🛠️ How It Works
- A **linear equation** is learned:  
  \[
  y = mx + c
  \]
- The model is trained using `LinearRegression()`
- Predictions are made for unknown study hours
